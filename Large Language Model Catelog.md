# Large Language Model Catalog

###### tags: `AGI`

## TODOs
- [ ] move local notes from obsidian to hackmd
- [ ] take notes from web links from safari tab groups
- [ ] organize structure of this catalog to make it easier to read

## Notes
- [#creativity]() LLMs are great for creativity tasks with the help of reflection and automated decision process as the nature of creativity accepts wrong answers in the process as long as the agent slowly approximates to the desired output in the end.
